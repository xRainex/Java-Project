APU Semester 4 Object Oriented Programming Assignment
I have completed an assignment that requires us to develop a system where students can book consultation appointments with different lecturers, they can also provide feedback. The lecturers can also give feedback to students after the consultations, as well as approve or reject consultation requests.
